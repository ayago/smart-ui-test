# Smart UI Test Demo

This project is a lean Spring Boot application designed to automate UI workflows testing based on structured input defined in a simple text file. It supports dynamic form filling, feature flag activation, and field verification using a flexible parsing and execution engine built on Selenium WebDriver.

**This is a Work In-Progress.**

## Features

* üß† Smart locator engine: Automatically finds input fields using labels, placeholders, name, id, or title attributes.
* üîß Feature flag activation: Enables/disables UI features before test execution using an API.
* ‚ôªÔ∏è Cache clearing support after feature changes.
* üìÑ Human-readable test flow format (`dashboard-flow.txt`) with support for:

    * Setting expected and given values
    * Triggering buttons
    * Enabling/disabling features
* ‚úÖ Dependency-injected modular architecture using Spring Boot.

## Project Structure

* `SmartUIRunner` ‚Äì Kicks off the test from the text file.
* `PageFlowParser` ‚Äì Parses the test flow file.
* `SmartLocatorEngine` ‚Äì Locates and interacts with form fields.
* `FeatureManagerClient` ‚Äì Enables features and clears cache via APIs.
* `WebDriverConfig` ‚Äì Configures Selenium WebDriver.
